# Phase 03.3 Plan 02: String Input Verification Summary

**End-to-end verification of string input functionality across UI, batch, and workflow pipelines with regression testing for numeric inputs**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T14:45:47Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T14:50:47Z (estimated)
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 0 (verification only)

## Accomplishments
- Frontend builds successfully with all string input changes from Plan 01
- User verified string input UI works correctly (SegmentedControl, conditional tabs, string value entry)
- User verified numeric input functionality unchanged (Range/CSV/Units all working)
- User verified string values preserved through batch and workflow pipelines
- User verified alias badge displays "1 values" for string inputs
- String input feature approved for production use

## Task Commits

Plan 02 is a verification plan - no code changes were made. The implementation was completed in Plan 01 (commits d557fea and 4460ca9).

| Task | Description | Verification Method |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Build and start application for testing | `npm run build` completed successfully with exit code 0 |
| 2 | End-to-end string input verification | User verified all 4 test scenarios and approved |

## Files Created/Modified

None - this is a verification plan. All code changes were completed in Plan 01.

## Decisions Made

**1. Frontend build verification sufficient for Task 1**
- Rationale: Running `npm run build` confirms that all TypeScript types, imports, and JSX syntax from Plan 01 are correct. No runtime errors mean the integration is clean.

**2. User verification covers all critical paths**
- Rationale: String input feature touches UI (InputModal), state management (App.tsx), and backend (worker.py). User testing all 4 scenarios (string UI, numeric regression, batch execution, workflow configuration) ensures the complete pipeline works end-to-end.

**3. No automated tests required at this stage**
- Rationale: This is a UI-heavy feature with manual user interaction (clicking tabs, typing strings, selecting types). UI integration tests would require significant test infrastructure (Playwright/Cypress) that doesn't exist yet. Manual verification is appropriate for this phase. Automated tests can be added in Phase 4 (Library) if needed.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Performed

**Test 1: String input UI (Batch tab)** ✓ PASSED
- SegmentedControl shows Number/String options, defaults to Number
- Switching to String hides Range tab and Units selector
- Single Value tab appears with TextInput for string entry
- String value saved correctly
- Alias table shows "1 values" badge

**Test 2: Numeric input regression (Batch tab)** ✓ PASSED
- Number type shows Range and CSV tabs (unchanged)
- Units dropdown visible and functional
- Numeric range configuration works correctly
- Badge shows correct value count (e.g., "5 values" for Start=1, End=5, Step=1)

**Test 3: String input batch execution** ✓ PASSED
- Batch executes with string inputs without errors
- Console/logs confirm string values passed to backend
- Mixed string/numeric inputs handled correctly

**Test 4: String input in workflow (Workflow tab)** ✓ PASSED
- InputModal opens with Number/String toggle in workflow context
- String input configuration saved to workflow file
- Type preservation works in workflow pipeline

## Issues Encountered

None. All verification tests passed on first attempt. No bugs or regressions found.

## User Setup Required

None - feature is ready for production use.

## Next Phase Readiness

- String input feature is complete and verified working end-to-end
- Frontend, backend, and MathcadPy integration confirmed functional
- Numeric input functionality confirmed regression-free
- Phase 03.3 (String Inputs) is complete
- Ready to proceed to Phase 4 (Library - configuration persistence) or Phase 5 (Packaging)
